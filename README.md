# EDA_-_FE_Projects
These are the projects I have made during my learnings below we can find some details about the project:
1. flight_price prediction
INFO Data set : The Flight Price Prediction dataset on Kaggle contains data on airline tickets including features like airline, source, destination, departure/arrival times, duration, stops, and price. It is commonly used for regression tasks to predict flight prices based on these attributes. The dataset includes around 10,000+ rows and is in CSV format.
INFO Project : I Applied EDA on the dataset to know the trend of price based on all the features by using 
Python programming and Libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn.

2. Play Store
INFO data : The Google Play Store Apps dataset includes information on over 10,000 Android apps, covering attributes like app name, category, rating, reviews, size, installs, type, price, and content rating.

INFO project : Build this project to sharp my Feature Engineering Skills in this project I applied Feature Engineering first so that we able to do EDA more effectively and can get the required information.

3. Red Vine 
INFO data: The Red Wine Quality dataset on Kaggle, originally from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, contains physicochemical properties (like acidity, sugar, pH, alcohol) of red "Vinho Verde" wines from Portugal, along with quality ratings. It's widely used for regression and classification tasks to predict wine quality based on these features. The dataset includes 1,599 samples and is available in CSV format.

INFO Project : Very popular data set on kaggle to test your EDA and Machine Learning skills Where I precticed to get diffrent answers through diffrent type of plots.
